Django-autoslug is a reusable Django library that provides an improved
slug field which can automatically:

a) populate itself from another field,
b) preserve uniqueness of the value and
c) use custom ``slugify()`` functions for better i18n.

The field is highly configurable.

Requirements
------------

*Python 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14.*

*Django 5.2 LTS or 6.0.*

Supported versions matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every cell below is exercised in CI on each push:

+----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
|                | Python 3.12  | Python 3.13  | Python 3.14  |
+================+==============+==============+==============+
| Django 5.2 LTS | ✓            | ✓            | ✓            |
+----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Django 6.0     | ✓            | ✓            | ✓            |
+----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+

Older Python and Django versions reached end-of-life and are no longer
supported by this fork:

* Django 4.2 LTS (extended support ended 2026-04-07)
* Django 5.0 / 5.1 (mainstream support ended)
* Python 3.9 / 3.10 / 3.11 (Django 5.2 minimum is 3.10, but Django 6.0
  requires 3.12+, so the intersection is 3.12+)

When Django 6.1 / 6.2 LTS ship, they will be added to the matrix.

It may be possible to successfully use django-autoslug-iplweb in other
environments but they are not tested.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: python

    python -m pip install django-autoslug

Examples
--------

A simple example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db.models import CharField, Model
    from autoslug import AutoSlugField

    class Article(Model):
        title = CharField(max_length=200)
        slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from='title')

More complex example:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.db.models import CharField, DateField, ForeignKey, Model
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from autoslug import AutoSlugField

    class Article(Model):
        title = CharField(max_length=200)
        pub_date = DateField(auto_now_add=True)
        author = ForeignKey(User)
        slug = AutoSlugField(populate_from=lambda instance: instance.title,
                             unique_with=['author__name', 'pub_date__month'],
                             slugify=lambda value: value.replace(' ','-'))
